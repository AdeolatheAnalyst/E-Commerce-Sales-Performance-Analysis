## Insights
This company thrives on two forces;
A loyal customer base and a powerful Electronics category, 
While Sports quietly waits as the next big growth opportunity, fueled by top ratings and the highest demand.

## Recommendations

-Study peak sales months and replicate what worked to smooth out revenue dips.

-Lightly discount and promote Sports products to unlock their full revenue potential.

-Double down on retention strategies, because loyal customers already carry the business.
